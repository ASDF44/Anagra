This is a web based software, that can be used for agricultural crop predictions and twin crop agricultural growth compatibility checker.

We have used both statistical as well as boinformatics approach in this software. The crop's prediction is done by using statistical model analysis, whereas the twin crop growth compatibility is performed by using the bioinformatic pathway.
